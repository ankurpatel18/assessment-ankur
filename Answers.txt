Bonus:
1) When we created the new group channel the channnel is empty. so it is not visible without sending a message.

2) while fetching the list of group channels we are set the query property called "includeEmpty" to FALSE.to display empty channel in list we have to set that value to TRUE

Ex. this.groupChannelQuery.includeEmpty = true;

3) Not able to work
